You can create a server status page for user to show your server status to public which wanna make others know.

## Configure custom domain

You can config your status page in your own domain, for example: `status.example.com`

set it in page config, and create a `CNAME` record in your DNS dashboard.

```
CNAME status.example.com tianji.example.com
```

then you can visit custom `status.example.com` to your page.
